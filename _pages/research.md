### Life Science Research Professional I at Stanford University, [Moore Lab](https://www.moorelabstanford.com)
#### January 2022 - Present
#### Advisor: [Dr. Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore)
- Designed a multi-class classification pipeline for the Neuropixels recording data of the spatial memory task.
- Utilized Thomas In Cage Training System (ICTS) to train nonhuman primates to perform feature-based learning task.
- Analyzed Neuropixels data using Kilosort an Phy software.

### Master’s Student at University College London, [Cortex Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab/)
#### January– November 2021 
#### Advisor: [Dr. Kevin J Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qSZJKJIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Kenneth Harris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jcYBNfIAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Conducted chronic Neuropixels recording on mice which are trained to do a dynamic two-armed bandit task.
- Utilized qualitative diagnostics and normalized cross-validated log likelihood scores (in Python) to evaluate 9 cognitive
models, including Q-learning variants, matching law variant, ideal observer variants, and mixture-of-agents model, to find
the best fitting model that could capture the mice behavior performing the dynamic two-armed bandit task.

### Research Assistant at Sungkyunkwan University, [Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://cocoanlab.github.io)
#### March – August 2018 
#### Advisor: [Choong-Wan Woo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fZLY5H8AAAAJ&hl=en)
- Facilitated 3T fMRI scanning and Biopac data collection. Analyzed 11 different surveys on mind-wandering and depression symptoms of 98 participants and examined bodymap graphs, which participants colored red if felt activated, blue if felt depressed, using MATLAB.
- Researched preprocessing methods for brain, respiration, electrocardiography (ECG) data, and helped preprocessing them using TAPAS code.
Duke University, Department of Medicine, Research Assistant January – June 2017 Advisor: Murali Doraiswamy North Carolina, United States
- Discovered cortisol as the most significant predictor of change in ADAS-Cog 11 followed by pro-insulin. Extracted data
from Alzheimer’s Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) database on patients who changed from LMCI to Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) along with their proteomics data over the course of their illness.
- Applied regression models to examine the relationship between log-transformed proteomic markers and ADAS-Cog 11
scores which show the patients’ current cognition scores.

### Research Assistant at Duke University, [Center for Advanced Hindsight](https://advanced-hindsight.com)
#### August 2016 – January 2017 
#### Advisor: Dan Ariely
- Derived behavioral patterns of fin-tech users through data analytics to transform low-income individual’s saving method, with Common Cents Lab within CAH. Surveyed low-income families in Durham and observed their spending/saving habits.
