I have divided my research experience into *computational* and *experimental* work. 

# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience


## Decoding spatial memory during delay (2022) [Github](https://github.com/jinoh5/decoding-working-memory) 
   - Work with [Dr. Matt Panichello](https://scholar.princeton.edu/mfp2/home), [Dr. Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore)
   - To research the amount of memorandum-selective information maintained in the spiking of the prefrontal neurons, I trained the multinomial logistic regression classifier to predict the cued stimulus location using NHP Neuropixels data. The result showed that during memory delay, classifier's confidence on single trial was fluctuate between high and low confidence states.
    
## Cognitive modeling (2021) [Github](https://github.com/jinoh5/cognitive_modeling)
   - Work with [Dr. Kevin J Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qSZJKJIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Kenneth Harris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jcYBNfIAAAAJ&hl=en)
   - To explore the hypotheses of the neural algorithms implemented by the brain to give rise to behavior, I modeled the choice datasets of head-fixed mice performing a dynamic two-armed bandit task. The key to finding a good fitting model was whether the model was able to capture the mice's choice perseverating behavioral pattern. 
    
## Human behavior analysis (2018) 
   - Work with [Dr. Choong-Wan Woo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fZLY5H8AAAAJ&hl=en)
   - I analyzed 11 different surveys on mind-wandering and depression symptoms of 98 participants and examined bodymap graphs using Matlab. 

## Proteomics data analysis (2017) 
   - Work with [Dr. Murali Doraiswamy](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dorai001)  
   - By extracting the proteomics data of the patients in Alzheimer’s Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) database, I was able to apply regression models to examine the relationship between log-transformed proteomic markers and ADAS-Cog 11
scores and discover that the cortisol is the most significant predictor of change in ADAS-Cog 11 followed by pro-insulin.

## Human behaivor analysis (2017) 
   - Work at [Center for Advanced Hindsight](https://advanced-hindsight.com)
   - I derived behavioral patterns of fin-tech users through data analytics to transform low-income individual’s saving method, with Common Cents Lab within CAH.

# Systems Neuroscience

 
## Training feature-based learning task (2022) 
   - Work with [Dr. Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore)
   - Use Thomas In Cage Training System (ICTS) to train nonhuman primates to perform feature-based learning task.

## Chronic Neuropixels recording on mouse (2021) 
   - Work with [Anna Lebedeva](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/anna-lebedeva)

## Training structured credit assignment task (2021) 
   - Work with [Dr. Kevin J Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qSZJKJIAAAAJ&hl=en)
