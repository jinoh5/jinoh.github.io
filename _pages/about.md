Hi! I am a post-master's researcher working at the [Moore Lab](https://www.moorelabstanford.com) under the guidance of [Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore). I received my Master's degree in Neuroscience at University College London under the supervision of [Kenneth Harris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jcYBNfIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Carandini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R3PGFHsAAAAJ&hl=en) and my Bachelor's degree at Duke University.

My main research interests are Decision-making, Cognitive modeling, Neuropixel recording, Reinforcement learning.
My research interest lies in the area of computational cognitive neuroscience. I am excited about understanding the neural mechanism and cognitive strategy behind humans or animals solving different cognitive tasks. In alignment with this interest, I want to investigate how natural intelligence can apply their prior knowledge to solve new challenges.
