Hi! I am a post-master's researcher working at the [Moore Lab](https://www.moorelabstanford.com) under the guidance of [Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore). I received my Master's degree in Neuroscience at University College London under the supervision of [Kenneth Harris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jcYBNfIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Carandini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R3PGFHsAAAAJ&hl=en) and my Bachelor's degree at [Duke University](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/undergraduate/neuroscience).

These are my research keywords: cognition, learning, working memory, decision-making, cognitive modeling, Neuropixels recording, reinforcement learning. 

I am excited about understanding cognition through the lens of computational cognitive systems neuroscience. 
In detail, I am interested in understanding the neural mechanism and cognitive strategy behind humans or animals solving different cognitive tasks. In alignment with this interest, I want to investigate how natural intelligence can apply their prior knowledge to solve new challenges.

## Recent Updates

[July 2022] I am using *LFADS* to explore the single trial dynamics of the spatial memory task during memory delay. Here is the open-source link to *auto-LFADS* [(link)](https://github.com/snel-repo/autolfads-tf2)
