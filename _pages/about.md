Hello! Welcome to my website! 

I am starting my computational neuroscience Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in the fall of 2023.

I was a post-Master's researcher working at the [Moore Lab](https://www.moorelabstanford.com) under the guidance of [Tirin Moore](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tirin-moore) at Stanford University. 

I received my Master's degree in Neuroscience at University College London under the supervision of [Kenneth Harris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jcYBNfIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Carandini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R3PGFHsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience at [Duke University](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/undergraduate/neuroscience).

These are my research keywords: cognition, learning, working memory, decision-making, cognitive modeling, Neuropixels recording, reinforcement learning. 

I am excited about understanding cognition through the lens of computational cognitive systems neuroscience. 
More specifically, I am interested in understanding the neural mechanism and cognitive strategy behind how humans or animals solving multiple cognitive tasks using prior knowledge, which could be shared action policy across tasks. 
In alignment with this interest, I want to investigate how natural intelligence can apply their prior knowledge to solve new challenges.

## Recent Updates
[September 2023] I am starting my Ph.D. at the [University of Chicago](https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/programs/computational-neuroscience). 

[July 2022] I am using *LFADS* to explore the single trial dynamics of the spatial memory task during memory delay. Here is the open-source link to *auto-LFADS* [(link)](https://github.com/snel-repo/autolfads-tf2)
